# Bard's Lesson
### About
Bard's Lesson is a platform game in which you help a bard fox in his journey to become a maestro by mastering music notation. Rowan, the fox, plays a piccolo and want to learn how to play it through the whistles of the birbs of the florest.

### Core Mechanics
To complete each level you must find and match every note of the staff using the time measure to deduce how many are yet to be found, birds sometimes are hidden, so you'll have to match'em all!
